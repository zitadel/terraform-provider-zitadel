    Provider to manage resources on ZITADEL

# ZITADEL Provider

This provider allows the management of different resources on a ZITADEL instance.

Through this provider it is possible to interact with the [ZITADEL API](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/introduction) to configure different aspects of the instance.

Currently does not contain, but could be included in the future if demand exists:

- instance as resource
- policies and settings on instance level as resource
- custom text resources

Not planned to include as resources, as more administration task as a resource:

- Import and export of organizations
- (re-)setting of password for human user
- initializing of OTP setup for human user
- initializing of passwordless setup for human user

## Configuring the provider

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zitadel = {
      source  = "zitadel/zitadel"
      version = "1.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "zitadel" {
  domain           = "localhost"
  insecure         = "true"
  port             = "8080"
  jwt_profile_file = "local-token"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `domain` (String) Domain used to connect to the ZITADEL instance

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) Personal Access Token to connect to ZITADEL. Either 'access_token', 'jwt_file', 'jwt_profile_file', 'jwt_profile_json' or 'system_api' is required
- `insecure` (Boolean) Use insecure connection
- `insecure_skip_verify_tls` (Boolean) Disable TLS certificate verification. Only use in development/testing environments with self-signed certificates.
- `jwt_file` (String) Path to the file containing presigned JWT to connect to ZITADEL. Either 'access_token', 'jwt_file', 'jwt_profile_file', 'jwt_profile_json' or 'system_api' is required
- `jwt_profile_file` (String) Path to the file containing credentials to connect to ZITADEL. Either 'access_token', 'jwt_file', 'jwt_profile_file', 'jwt_profile_json' or 'system_api' is required
- `jwt_profile_json` (String) JSON value of credentials to connect to ZITADEL. Either 'access_token', 'jwt_file', 'jwt_profile_file', 'jwt_profile_json' or 'system_api' is required
- `port` (String) Used port if not the default ports 80 or 443 are configured
- `system_api` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration block for authenticating with the ZITADEL System API using a PEM encoded key. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--system_api))
- `token` (String) Path to the file containing credentials to connect to ZITADEL
- `transport_headers` (Map of String) Custom headers to add to both HTTP (authentication) and gRPC (API) requests. Useful for proxy authentication (e.g., GCP IAP with Proxy-Authorization header).
