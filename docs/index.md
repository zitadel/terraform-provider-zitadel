# ZITADEL Provider

This provider allows the management of different resources on a ZITADEL instance.

Through this provider it is possible to interact with the [ZITADEL API](https://docs.zitadel.com/docs/apis/introduction) to configure different aspects of the instance.

Currently does not contain, but could be included in the future if demand exists:

- instance as resource
- policies and settings on instance level as resource
- custom text resources

Not planned to include as resources, as more administration task as a resource:

- Import and export of organizations
- (re-)setting of password for human user
- initializing of OTP setup for human user
- initializing of passwordless setup for human user

## Configuring the provider

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zitadel = {
      source  = "zitadel/zitadel"
      version = "1.0.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "zitadel" {
  domain           = "localhost"
  insecure         = "true"
  port             = "8080"
  jwt_profile_file = "local-token"
